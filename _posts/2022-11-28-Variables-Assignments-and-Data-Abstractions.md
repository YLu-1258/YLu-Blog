## Unit 3.1: Variables and Assignments
- Variables are abstractions within programs which represent a value
- Values can be individual data points or a list/collection that contains many data values
- Types of data: numbers, Booleans (T/F), lists, and strings


### Python
To define variables, just establish a variable name, and then use the equal sign to set it equal to a value, wheter it be a string, character, list, or boolean.

### Javascript
global variables can be defined with the `var` keyword  

Constant variables could be defined with the `const` keyword  

Local variables could be defined with the `let` keyword.  

## Unit 3.2: Data Abstraction
- A list is made up of elements organized in a specific order
- An element is a unique, individual value in a list
- A string differs from a list as it is a sequence of characters rather than elements
- Data abstraction uses a list by taking specific data elements from a list and organizing into a whole, less complex representation of the values such as a table

### Python
In python, lists could be used to organize similar data structures. 

Lists could be split with the `.split()` method. The `deliminator` for the splitting operation could be set within the parenthesis. By default, the deliminator are whitespace characters.

Lists could also be joined into a variable with the `.join()` method. A deliminator could also be set for such a list.
