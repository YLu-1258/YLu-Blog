- Company Mission Statements:
    - HP Inc: ***Create technology that makes life better for everyone, every where.***
    - Qualcomm: ***Inventing the tech the world loves.***
    - Thermo Fisher Scientific: ***Enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner, and safer.***
- These tech companies all have a macro and global impact on the world due to their size.
- At one point, qualcomm chips were in 99% of the world's cell phones, and that a billion people have their lives impacted by qualcomm
- Thermo Fisher stats:
    - more than 100,000 colleagues
    - 7,000 enginners and scientists
    - $1.5 Billion invested in research
    - more than 40 Billion$ in revenue
- Mrs. Beveridge is a senior director of marketing and sales at thermo fisher, lots of people work underneathe her.
- They would often give their opinions on a product before it's release or commercialization. 
    - Work closely with a scrum master to commercialize the product.
    - Similar team structure to what we have in APCSP

## Q and A:
### Agile Methodology?
> Different companies have different types of agile. workers at qualcomm would plan everything for each quarter in big meetings spanning 2-3 days. Good way to coordinate with other people working on similar projects as you.
> Always doing short sprints, short times in 2 or 1 months. People can actually even get certification in doing sprints.

### Twitter Layoffs?
> You don't wait for companies to shuffle, you have to look ahead and start planning.

### Machine Learning Frameworks?
> learning how to use keras and tensorflow frameworks, in conjunction with gitlab as a tool to be able to predict to see when to archive and delete repositories. It would help to save qualcomm a lot of money for hosting.
> Data Scientists, join massive database fragments to predict consumer trends and other such information. Data analytics could also be used in non technical roles for different uses.

### Most important skill in tech industry?
> Continuous Learning is paramount for this field, different companies have different ways of doing things, different languages and conventions. Also don't be too concerned about things on the news, programming is supposed to be a self ful-filling job.
> The best technical people listen to the requirements and can translate it into how technology could fulfill the requirements.

### Biggest challenge in tech industry
> Interviews are pretty intense now, especially for silicon valley tech companies. Especially stressful as they give you a limited amount of time to pass a certain problem.
