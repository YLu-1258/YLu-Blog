# Reflection on the questions:
I was able to retain a high level of accuracy as I did this MCQ. I was able to get a perfect score on this practice exam, and I feel like I am confident for the materials on the exam. I think that as long as I get a good night of rest before the exam, I should be able to score good. To review for this test, I used online resources such as khan academy and also fiveable for a quick review of all the concepts. I feel like the only parts that I should review before th exam should be copyright and data conversions (analog to digital), and I should then be fine.
