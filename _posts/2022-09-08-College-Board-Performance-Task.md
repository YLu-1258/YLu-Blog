# College Board Create Performance Task

## Row 1: Program Purpose and Function
> Assesses students’ ability to explain how a code segment or program functions.
Know the difference between program **purpose** and **function**
> The purpoes and function is what the program was meant to do
The purpose of the **Quiz** program: To assess knowledge on a topic.
The purpose of **InfoDb**:           To store and access user information.

## Row 2: Data Abstraction
> Assesses students’ ability to use abstraction to manage complexity in a program.
The Abstraction and storage of data in a generalized container, e.g. variables, lists, dictionaries

## Row 3: Managing Complexity
> Assesses students’ ability to explain how abstraction manages complexity.
The `print_data` function in the InfoDb project helps to reduce the amount of code that has to be written, as the code under print_data was *abstracted* from the function that was pre-defined.

Helps to reduce complexity in the code as everything is compartmentalized.

## Row 4: Prodecural Abstraction
> Assesses students’ ability to use abstraction to manage complexity in a program.
The `print_data` function used in the InfoDb project was abstracted into the various for loops that the program used.

## Row 5: Algorithm Implementation
> Assesses students’ ability to implement and apply an algorithm.
An algorithm is a methodology or a logical path that a computer follows to properly, 

Ex: The percentage of the score in the quiz was an example of an algorithm

## Row 6: Testing
> Assesses students’ ability to investigate the situation, context, or task.
Testing is running over all the processes in a program and ensuring that everything works. The ability to find, detect, and fix any bugs apparent in the program.
