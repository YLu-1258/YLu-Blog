# College Board Create Performance Task


## Plan and Ideas
A program that creates a hang-man game for the user.

## Row 1: Program Purpose and Function
> Assesses students’ ability to explain how a code segment or program functions.
Know the difference between program **purpose** and **function**
> The purpoes and function is what the program was meant to do
Examples: 
The purpose of the **Quiz** program: To assess knowledge on a topic.
The purpose of **InfoDb**:           To store and access user information.

The purpose of this game is to create a word guessing game, where the user guesses certain letters, and the program will automatically fill in any letters present in the target word that the user inputs. After a given amount of tries, if the user hasn't guessed the word, the game will fail itself.

## Row 2: Data Abstraction
> Assesses students’ ability to use abstraction to manage complexity in a program.
The Abstraction and storage of data in a generalized container, e.g. variables, lists, dictionaries

The hangman game will predominantly use lists and variables to store the necessary data for the game. The variables could hold the different "stages" of the hangman ascii-art. On the otherhand, lists could be used to keep track of the already used letters and the letters 

## Row 3: Managing Complexity
> Assesses students’ ability to explain how abstraction manages complexity.
The `print_data` function in the InfoDb project helps to reduce the amount of code that has to be written, as the code under print_data was *abstracted* from the function that was pre-defined.

Helps to reduce complexity in the code as everything is compartmentalized.

## Row 4: Prodecural Abstraction
> Assesses students’ ability to use abstraction to manage complexity in a program.
The `print_data` function used in the InfoDb project was abstracted into the various for loops that the program used.

## Row 5: Algorithm Implementation
> Assesses students’ ability to implement and apply an algorithm.
An algorithm is a methodology or a logical path that a computer follows to properly, 

Ex: The percentage of the score in the quiz was an example of an algorithm

## Row 6: Testing
> Assesses students’ ability to investigate the situation, context, or task.
Testing is running over all the processes in a program and ensuring that everything works. The ability to find, detect, and fix any bugs apparent in the program.


## How to Get a Five
### REVIEW PAST NOTES FROM CLASS
Be sure to be clear on the vocab and content taught in the class. Be parepared to be able to properly define each vocabulary and provide examples to each vocab. Any questions that cannot be answered with my notes, ask the teammates first and then
