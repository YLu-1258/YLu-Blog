## Notes from Collegeboard videos   

### 1.1 Collaboration
**Learning Objectives**  
CRD - 1.A *Explain how innovations are improved through collaboration.*  
CRD - 1.A.1 *A computing innovation includes a program as an integral part of its function.*  
CRD - 1.A.2 *A computer innovation can be physica (i.e., self-driving car), non physical computing software (e.g., picture editing software), or a nonphysical computng concept (e.g., e-commerce).*  
CRD - 1.A.3 *Effective collaboration produces a computing innovation that reflects the diversity of talents and perspectives of those who designed it.*  
CRD - 1.A.4 *Collaboration that incudes diverse perspectives helps avoid bias in the development of computing innovations*  
CRD - 1.C *Demonstrate effective interpersonal skills during collaboration.*  
CRD - 1.C.1 *Effective collaborative teams practice interpersonal skills, including, but not limited to: Communication, Consesus Building, Conflict Resolution, Negotiation*  
  
**Notes**  
Different people in different departments work on different subjects and interests.  

A program always start up with an idea, purpose and plan. A program must have requirements of the that meet the necessary constraints it must meet.  

Developers are able to practice better interpersonal skills in a diverse team.  

**Pair Programming:** One programmer types the code, while the other reviews each line of code.  
  
**Think-Pair-Share:** Students think through a problem alone, pair with a partner to share ideas, and then share results with the class  

## 1.2: Program Function and Purpose
**Learning Objectives**  
CRD - 2.A - *Describe the purpose of a computing innovation.*  
CRD - 2.A.1 - *The purpose of computing innovations is to solve problems or to pursue interests through creative expression.*  
CRD - 2.A.2 - *An understanding of the purpose of a computing innovation provides developers with an improved abiltiy to develop that essential knowledge on.*  

**Notes**  
Different innovations are contained under different categories of innovations  

Program inputs are pecies of data that are sent to computers for processing and interpretation. The computer will then perform operations and manipulate teh data in order to produce a desirable. Inputs can either come from the user themselves, or from another program.  

Every event in a program is associated with an action that supplies an input to the program.  

**Event Driven Programming:** Program segments and code fragments are executed based on events that trigger specific control flow structures rather an a smooth, sequential flow.  

A program is a collection of software statements that collectively serves a specific use and performs a certain task.

The program works for a variety of inputs and situations. (Think of it like a function)
