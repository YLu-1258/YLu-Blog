<h3 id="Hack-#1---Class-Notes">Hack #1 - Class Notes<a class="anchor-link" href="#Hack-#1---Class-Notes"> </a></h3><p>Write any extra notes you have here
1) We run simulations all the time to test projected results in real life
2) Simulations could help us represent various real life scenarios with many of their random values and nature with spinners and rngs
3) Many different examples can be simulated
    1) Air traffic
    2) Chemical Reactions
    3) Missile launches
4) We can use the python random module to run various simulations in our programs. For instance, random number generators could be used to simulate different probabilities and such.</p>

<li>A researcher gathers data about the effect of Advanced Placement®︎ classes on students' success in college and career, and develops a simulation to show how a sequence of AP classes affect a hypothetical student's pathway.Several school administrators are concerned that the simulation contains bias favoring high-income students, however.<ul>
<li>answer options:<ol>
<li>The simulation is an abstraction and therefore cannot contain any bias</li>
<li>The simulation may accidentally contain bias due to the exclusion of details.</li>
<li>If the simulation is found to contain bias, then it is not possible to remove the bias from the simulation.</li>
<li>The only way for the simulation to be biased is if the researcher intentionally used data that favored their desired output.</li>

<li>Jack is trying to plan his financial future using an online tool. The tool starts off by asking him to input details about his current finances and career. It then lets him choose different future scenarios, such as having children. For each scenario chosen, the tool does some calculations and outputs his projected savings at the ages of 35, 45, and 55.Would that be considered a simulation and why?<ul>
<li>answer options<ol>
<li>No, it's not a simulation because it does not include a visualization of the results.</li>
<li>No, it's not a simulation because it does not include all the details of his life history and the future financial environment.</li>
<li>Yes, it's a simulation because it runs on a computer and includes both user input and computed output.</li>
<li>Yes, it's a simulation because it is an abstraction of a real world scenario that enables the drawing of inferences.</li>

<li>Sylvia is an industrial engineer working for a sporting goods company. She is developing a baseball bat that can hit balls with higher accuracy and asks their software engineering team to develop a simulation to verify the design.Which of the following details is most important to include in this simulation?<ul>
<li>answer options<ol>
<li>Realistic sound effects based on the material of the baseball bat and the velocity of the hit</li>
<li>A depiction of an audience in the stands with lifelike behavior in response to hit accuracy</li>
<li>Accurate accounting for the effects of wind conditions on the movement of the ball</li>
<li>A baseball field that is textured to differentiate between the grass and the dirt</li>

<li>Ashlynn is an industrial engineer who is trying to design a safer parachute. She creates a computer simulation of the parachute opening at different heights and in different environmental conditions.What are advantages of running the simulation versus an actual experiment?<ul>
<li>answer options<ol>
<li>The simulation will not contain any bias that favors one body type over another, while an experiment will be biased.</li>
<li>The simulation can be run more safely than an actual experiment</li>
<li>The simulation will accurately predict the parachute's safety level, while an experiment may be inaccurate due to faulty experimental design.</li>
<li>The simulation can test the parachute design in a wide range of environmental conditions that may be difficult to reliably reproduce in an experiment.</li>

Ashlynn is an industrial engineer who is trying to design a safer parachute. She creates a computer simulation of the parachute opening at different heights and in different environmental conditions.What are advantages of running the simulation versus an actual experiment?
A) The simulation will not contain any bias that favors one body type over another, while an experiment will be biased.
B) The simulation can be run more safely than an actual experiment.
C) The simulation will accurately predict the parachute&#39;s safety level, while an experiment may be inaccurate due to faulty experimental design.
D) The simulation can test the parachute design in a wide range of environmental conditions that may be difficult to reliably reproduce in an experiment.

A researcher gathers data about the effect of Advanced Placement®︎ classes on students&#39; success in college and career, and develops a simulation to show how a sequence of AP classes affect a hypothetical student&#39;s pathway.Several school administrators are concerned that the simulation contains bias favoring high-income students, however.
A) The simulation is an abstraction and therefore cannot contain any bias.
B) The simulation may accidentally contain bias due to the exclusion of details.
C) If the simulation is found to contain bias, then it is not possible to remove the bias from the simulation.
D) The only way for the simulation to be biased is if the researcher intentionally used data that favored their desired output.
Correct! Nice Job!
Which of the following ways can we best simulate a spinner?
A) Having the user randomly pick a number.

C) Hard code a random sequence in the source code.
D) Use some pattern in nature to return a random value
Correct! Nice Job!
What module in python could be used to generate random values in simulation experiments?
A) random
B) randint
C) turtle
D) tensorflow

Jack is trying to plan his financial future using an online tool. The tool starts off by asking him to input details about his current finances and career. It then lets him choose different future scenarios, such as having children. For each scenario chosen, the tool does some calculations and outputs his projected savings at the ages of 35, 45, and 55.Would that be considered a simulation and why?
A) No, it&#39;s not a simulation because it does not include a visualization of the results.
B) No, it&#39;s not a simulation because it does not include all the details of his life history and the future financial environment.
C) Yes, it&#39;s a simulation because it runs on a computer and includes both user input and computed output.
D) Yes, it&#39;s a simulation because it is an abstraction of a real world scenario that enables the drawing of inferences.
