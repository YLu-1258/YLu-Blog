    "\n",
    "Our team wishes to build a minesweeper game with a python backend that could consistently communicate with our front-end website to bring a new degree of sophistication and aesthetic to this classic Game. This project would be split into two main portions each with it's own challenge. The first portion would be making the game engine in python, while the latter portion would be to design and create an aesthetically pleasing and functional frontend to display the Game Status"

    "## The Backend\n",
    "Arguably the more challenging half of this project, the backend would primarily serve to be the game engine of the minesweeper game. Additionally, the backend would also control and organize the various pages and menus on the website. In this writeup, we will only be focusing on the main goals and challenges faced by the Backend team.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Using Object Oriented Programming to create individual objects for the game. Some aspects that could be represented by such objects would be the gameboard and also the individual cells and nodes present within the game board.\n",
    "    1. Doing so would simplify the algorithmic aspect of the game, as the board itself could have methods and attributes to help control the game logic. \n",
    "    2. Morever, using an object to represent an individual cell in the board would provide greater functionalities than just using a single variable  \n",
    "2. Use Enumerated types with the python `enum` module to create different values for the type and status of each node. Each of these types could then be bound to a constant value which could then be printed on the screen\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Use Recursion to create an algorithm to recursively detect adjacent cells that are safe (AKA not mines). This algorithm would work in the following format\n",
    "    1. Maintain a list of current cells already determined to be safe\n",
    "    2. Verify if the four adjacent (up, down, left, right) cells next to the selected cell are safe or not, if safe, store the coordinate point in the list, if not, record the cell as a \"border cell\", terminate the recursive process, and run another helper function to determine the precise number of mines surrounding the cell\n",
    "    3. Re-call the function for each of the surrounding adjacent cells to identify other consecutive cells who are safe.\n",
    "    4. Return a list of the coordinates of a contiguous block of safe cells\n",
    "    5. Mark the cells to be safe and calculate number of surrounding mines for border cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Verify the Game status, Game is won if:\n",
    "    1. All mines are flagged\n",
    "    2. All safe cells are cleared\n",
    "    Game is lost if:\n",
    "    1. A mine was dug by the user\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Return the final result back to the front end. If a safe cell was dug, send out a JSON containing an array of the coordinates of the cell and it's safe neighbors. If a mine was dug, send a JSON containing a boolean value to signify the end of the game. \n"

    "    - Use the `random` module to generate a set of integers within the bounds of the array, generate two integers from each mine to indicate the row or coloumn coordinate. Finally, add both generated values into a tuple which will then be appended to a list containing all of the mine coordinates.\n",
    "    - AS OF **10/10** Consider using the `RapidAPI minesweeper API` to generate a board. (However this limits our flexibility as the first mine clicked might be an actual mine, leading to an inevitable loss).\n",
    "- Use an overall gameloop that checks the status of the game on each \"turn of the game\" (iteration of the game).\n",
    "    - If `gameOver == true`, signify that the game is over\n",
    "        - Use control flow statements such as if-else-elif to determine wether or not a user has clicked on a mine. If yes, set `gameOver` to `true`, if not, continue with the current iteration of the loop. \n",
    "        - Based on the current state of the board, if there are no mines left, return a win screen. If there are mines left, assume that the player clicked on a mine and return a lose screen.\n",
    "- Within each iteration, prompt the user to input a coordinate point (When testing, use terminal input with standard `(x,y)` input, for the final product, clicking each cell should return a coordinate automatically to the python backend).\n",
    "    - **Hard part is detecting a nearby \"safe grid\" for each mine clicked, while subsequently revealing all the mines in the safe grid**\n",
    "    - We have decided to use a **recursive** approach to resolve this problem. The recursive approach will store a list of safe mines. It will first append the mine clicked by the user (assuming that the mine passes the safe check). Following this, the algorithm will then check the `(r+1,c), (r+1,c-1), (r+1,c+1), (r,c-1), (r,c+1), (r-1,c), (r-1,c-1), and (r-1,c+1)` coordinates to determine wether or not surrouding cells are safe or not. Recursively execute the same process for each the 8 mines adjacent to the initial cell and stop until an \"edge-mine\" is reached.\n",
