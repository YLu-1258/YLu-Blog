We would then first execute this process, while esecuting shorter processes on the second processor to reduce the overall running time. Since the two other processes Y and Z are 10 and 30 seconds respectfully, we see that it would take a total of 40 seconds for both processes to finish sequentially on the second processor, which is less time than it would take process X to finish on the first processor. Thus, becayse 50>40seconds, it would take a minimum of 50 seconds to execute all 3 processes.\n",

    "  - If we run the two processes sequentially on the same processor, it would take a total of 70 seconds to complete. However, if we were to run the two processes in parallel it would take the same amount of time as it would of the longest process, as the shortest process will finish concurrently while the longer processes is still running. Thus, if run in parallel we would have a total running time or 45 seconds. 70-45 = 25, so we know that the difference in running time is 25 seconds.\n",
