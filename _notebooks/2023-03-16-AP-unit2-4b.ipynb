    "- What is a database schema?\n",
    "    - **A database schema serves as the outline and a blueprint of all tables and associated attributes within a database.**\n",
    "- What is the purpose of identity Column in SQL database?\n",
    "    - **The Identity colun is a numeric column in databases that can be automatically populated with numeric values. Typically, to declare an identity column in the database schema, we would define a seed (intial value) and an incrementation value. Each table can only have 1 identity column.**\n",
    "- What is the purpose of a primary key in SQL database?\n",
    "    - **The primary key in a SQL database serves to act as an identifier for a particular database entry. The values in this column must be unique and non-NULL. Similar to the identity column, each table in a database can only have 1 primary key.**\n",
    "        - *On the other hand, a composite key is one that operates with multiple columns in a table, and serves to uniquely identify a row based on the contents of the corresponding columns. EX: ProductID and UserID, these columns could have non-unique IDs, but every pair in the database must be unique.*\n",
    "- What are the Data Types in SQL table?\n",
    "    - **There are many data types for SQL. The most common types represent string and numeric data**\n",

    "| String | VARCHAR(size) | Stores are variable length string. |\n",
    "| String | TEXT(size) | Holds a string with a maximum size of 65,535 bytes |\n",
    "|  |  |  |\n",
    "| Numeric | INTEGER(size) | Stores a signed integer (-2147483648 to 2147483647) or unsigned integer (0 to 4294967295) |\n",
