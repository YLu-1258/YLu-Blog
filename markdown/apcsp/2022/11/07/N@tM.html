<p>The Night at the Museum was an event coordinated by the visual arts and computer science departments to create an opportunity for students to observe and learn from the projects of others while benefiting from their gains. The projects displayed by the Tri 1 APCSP classes utilized two web applications with one designated for Frontend display and one for Backend processing. The two endpoints were linked up via an API developed on the backend, which allows for communication between backend and frontend and ultimately interactive webpages.</p>

<h2 id="our-project">
<a class="anchor" href="#our-project" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Our Project</h2>
<p>We created a minesweeper game that boasts an ability that allows for individual users to log in into an account that they can create on the home page. This system is created by our backend API which stores users and their credentials and information in a 2 dimensional python dictionary. Ultimately, this allows for our user to play the minesweeper game while allowing them to freely store their high scores so long as the website is up.</p>
