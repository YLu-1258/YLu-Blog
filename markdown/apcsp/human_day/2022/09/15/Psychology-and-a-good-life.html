  <p><em>We can control and improve our happiness a lot more than we think.</em></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Happiness may be somewhat herritable, but it is still mostly in our control and it’s our decisions that dictate our happiness.</li>
    <li>If our genes control 50% of our happiness, then it stands to reason that we have control over the other 50%.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><em>Rent, work, and School may be important, but are they more important to us than happiness?</em></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Lottery winners are happy on the day they win the lottery
      <ul>
        <li>But months later, lottery winners have the same happiness as they did before winning</li>
      </ul>

    <li>The opposite applies to bad scenarios
      <ul>
        <li>Unfortunate events may cause frustration and sadness in the instant they happen, but they will dissipate quickly over time too</li>
        <li>We as humans get used to it</li>

    <li>Individuals who experience catastrophic events are more likely to view life with a positive attitude, viewing their life as more precious</li>

  <p><em>Just how hard is it to be happy?</em></p>
  <ul>
    <li>We can control our happiness through our behaviors</li>
    <li>It takes daily work and effort to be happy
      <ul>
        <li>Unhappy people can do happy things everyday and persevere that way to feel happy</li>

    <li>Any big event in life requires effort, happiness is the same</li>
    <li>A change in happiness requires permenant changes that persist every day of our life</li>
    <li>training happiness is similar to exercising</li>

  <p><em>Our mind is lying to us</em></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Our mind forcasts things that makes us happy, but in reality it does not</li>
    <li>People correlate salary (money) with happiness

        <li>People at different salary levels have different expectations, 30k -&gt; 50k -&gt; 100k … etc</li>

  <p><em>Very happy people prioritize social connections</em></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Very happy people spend more time with others and less time alone
      <ul>
        <li>Prioritize the stuff that works</li>
