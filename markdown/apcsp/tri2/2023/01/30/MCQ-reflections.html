<p>Overall I scored a 48/50 on this MCQ, which isnâ€™t a bad score. However, there are definitely still more places where I can improve and reinforce my knowledge for the class.</p>

<h2 id="question-30">Question 30</h2>

<p>On this problem, I incorrectly responded with B and D, when the actual correct answer was B and C. The main issue with me answering this problem wrong was not because of my knowledge, but simply because I was too careless in answering the last few questions. Option D is wrong because although it starts out with the right center coordinates, it starts with an initial radius of 3, but quickly decrements it to 2 for the first circle, which would ultimately scale down the true sizes of the circles. A better option would be choice C, which uses almost the same sequencing, but prints out the circle first before decrementing, which would result in the right response</p>

<h2 id="question-33">Question 33</h2>
<p><img src="/YLu-Blog/images/33.png" alt="" title=" " /></p>

<p>On this problem, I failed to recognize that the possible input to the program could be negative. By excluding negative values, I made the erroneous assumption that the given inputs will always be positive numbers, hence always greater than -1, and overwriting the intial value. However, if all inputs were negative values smaller than -1, the first program would return the wrong value as -1 would be greater than all other inpout values, and thus never updated. Thus in this scenario, the program will output -1, the initial condition, instead of the true maximum. I was correct to assume that the other algorithm would work well.</p>
