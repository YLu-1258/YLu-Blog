<h2 id="unit-31-variables-and-assignments">Unit 3.1: Variables and Assignments</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Variables are abstractions within programs which represent a value</li>
  <li>Values can be individual data points or a list/collection that contains many data values</li>
  <li>Types of data: numbers, Booleans (T/F), lists, and strings</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="python">Python</h3>
<p>To define variables, just establish a variable name, and then use the equal sign to set it equal to a value, wheter it be a string, character, list, or boolean.</p>

<h3 id="javascript">Javascript</h3>
<p>global variables can be defined with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">var</code> keyword</p>

<p>Constant variables could be defined with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">const</code> keyword</p>

<p>Local variables could be defined with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">let</code> keyword.</p>

<h2 id="unit-32-data-abstraction">Unit 3.2: Data Abstraction</h2>
<ul>
  <li>A list is made up of elements organized in a specific order</li>
  <li>An element is a unique, individual value in a list</li>
  <li>A string differs from a list as it is a sequence of characters rather than elements</li>
  <li>Data abstraction uses a list by taking specific data elements from a list and organizing into a whole, less complex representation of the values such as a table</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="python-1">Python</h3>
<p>In python, lists could be used to organize similar data structures.</p>

<p>Lists could be split with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.split()</code> method. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">deliminator</code> for the splitting operation could be set within the parenthesis. By default, the deliminator are whitespace characters.</p>

<p>Lists could also be joined into a variable with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.join()</code> method. A deliminator could also be set for such a list.</p>
