<h2 id="q-and-a">Q and A:</h2>
<h3 id="agile-methodology">Agile Methodology?</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Different companies have different types of agile. workers at qualcomm would plan everything for each quarter in big meetings spanning 2-3 days. Good way to coordinate with other people working on similar projects as you.
Always doing short sprints, short times in 2 or 1 months. People can actually even get certification in doing sprints.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="twitter-layoffs">Twitter Layoffs?</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>You don’t wait for companies to shuffle, you have to look ahead and start planning.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="machine-learning-frameworks">Machine Learning Frameworks?</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>learning how to use keras and tensorflow frameworks, in conjunction with gitlab as a tool to be able to predict to see when to archive and delete repositories. It would help to save qualcomm a lot of money for hosting.
Data Scientists, join massive database fragments to predict consumer trends and other such information. Data analytics could also be used in non technical roles for different uses.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="most-important-skill-in-tech-industry">Most important skill in tech industry?</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Continuous Learning is paramount for this field, different companies have different ways of doing things, different languages and conventions. Also don’t be too concerned about things on the news, programming is supposed to be a self ful-filling job.
The best technical people listen to the requirements and can translate it into how technology could fulfill the requirements.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="biggest-challenge-in-tech-industry">Biggest challenge in tech industry</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Interviews are pretty intense now, especially for silicon valley tech companies. Especially stressful as they give you a limited amount of time to pass a certain problem.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="reflections">Reflections:</h2>
<p>Through this experience, I realized that there was much more to the tech industry than just learning how to code. Because technology changes rapidly over time, I will need to be able to continuously learn from my experiences and also from those around me in order to keep up with the trends. It is only through a skillset such as this that I may remain of good use to the company and thrive in the corporate scenario. It was also intruiging to learn about the many challenges and experiences of these tech workers, and I particularly enjoyed the part where they introduced how the agile methodology was applied in their workplace as well as their interviewing experiences. Finally, it was also enlightening to learn about the violatile job market, in order to remain employed, I must be able to look to the future and predict when would be a good time to prepare to change jobs. Overall, this was a very enlightening experience and I would love to discuss this topic with others!</p>
