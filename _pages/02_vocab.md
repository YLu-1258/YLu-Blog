# Vocab
The Vocab should be oriented in this fashion

| Vocab | Definition | Example |
    


| Vocab | Definition | Example |
|-|-|-|
| **Pseudo-Code**| A mere representation of actual code, used as a blue print of something we wish to write | DISPLAY(msg) |
| **Sequence** | Any block of code that contains more than one singular line| #include <bits/stdc++.h>; using name space std; int main() { cout <<"Hello World"; return 0 } |
| **Procedural Extraction and Data Extraction** | taking little parts of code and putting them into different files and locations to be used as part of a whole | Index.html and other html fragments |
