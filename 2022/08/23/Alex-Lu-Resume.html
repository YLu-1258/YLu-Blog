      <p>Recently I’ve developed a growing interest in the Machine Learning field. I’m most proficient with traditional programming, but the growth in the popularity of Machine Learning opened my eyes to its future potential. Although I still view myself as a beginner in the field, I hope to improve over time and develop the necessary skills for my own projects.</p>
